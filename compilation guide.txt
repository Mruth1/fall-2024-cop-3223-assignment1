On the pretense that you are running linux back end please follow trhese compilation instructings as such

From terminal 


gcc -o fracturing fracturing.c -lm && ./fracturing.out
// I believe this is dependant on how you compile & execute the code, if so use .exe instead of .out if using a windows backed terminal
